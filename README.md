# SyvIT
Want to have a security website for any freelance work. Making a website associated with and using it to also refresh my own knowledge.

10/09/2023 -- rebranding even though its not registered business or anything, syit is clearly taken. I will leave the domain url as syit, to avoid broken links.
Assuming i would have to rebrand regardless so I am going to annotate all branding spots so anyone can copypasta this for there own purposes.

10/08/2023 -- fine tuned

10/07/2023---Basic site set-up, fun endevour. Caught a handful of mistakes and went down memory lane of WebDev. Note quite the way I want yet, but a good start.
